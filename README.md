# Set-Timeout-and-Interval-Problems



Practice dealing with asynchronous functions like `setTimeout` and 
`setInterval`. Your objective is to implement the functions in each file
of the `/problems` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the 
top of each file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. add `mocha` to script in package.json 
4. `npm run test` to run the test cases
